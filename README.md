# LeetCodeApp

This is a desktop client for one of the amazing sites for code practice - leetcode.com.

It's written in C++. GUI is based on Qt framework.

<h2> Dependencies: </h2>

This is my previous pet-project. New-gained skills are libcurl (i wish i've chosen boost.beast to do it, lol), https protocol, get/post requests. 
And also this is my first project on Qt Framework created in Visual Studio by using Qt Tools.
